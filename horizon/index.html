<h1 align="center">Horizon</h1>
<p><em>Horizon</em> is a GIS tool designed for archaeoastronomers investigating alignments of prehistoric monuments with astronomical phenomena
  (<em>e.g.</em> rising and setting of the Sun, Moon and stars). It gets its name from its primary function, which is calculating accurate horizon 
  profiles using DTM/DEM mapping data. More generally, it is a landscape visualisation tool which can generate full 360-degree panoramic scenes 
  using 3D rendering techniques, which may have some applications in the field of landscape archaeology. Possible applications include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Analysis of field measurements using calculated horizons which are not subject to obscuration by atmospheric conditions, vegetation or modern structures.</li>
  <li>Allows an archaeologist working in the field to visualise astronomical phenomena in relation to the observed landscape. The software has been deliberately
      designed with minimal computing resource requirements so that it can be run on small portable computers.</li>
  <li>Creating realistic horizons for use with <a href="http://www.stellarium.org"><em>Stellarium</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This program is not, and never will be, a realtime virtual reality (VR) simulator, a tool for rendering photorealistic images, or a planetarium 
   simulator. There are plenty of other programs around that do these things better.</p>


<h2>Download and Install</h2>

<p><em>Horizon</em> Version&nbsp;0.13c was released on 30-Jan-2020.  It can be downloaded from
   <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ypd3xfzocjpha6wx6ea7g/Horizon013c.msi?rlkey=9by5bs49af1x4bued24wx505o&st=wsfjh1hz&dl=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>The installation package contains the <em>Horizon</em> executable and the documentation in PDF format, and will create links to both the executable
   and the documentation in the Programs menu under the Start button, as well as an icon on the Desktop.  The executable is distributed as a MSI (Microsoft
   Installer) package, so installation is largely automatic.  The installer isn't very smart, so it is a good idea to manually uninstall the previous version, 
   if any, before you install the new version (through Control Panel - Add or Remove Programs). Then click on the installation package and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>This version of the software should run under Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000 or higher (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 or 11). In addition, it requires that the 
   Microsoft .Net Framework Version&nbsp;2.0 be installed first, if it has not been so already. The package you will need to install (if any) depends on which
   version of the operating system you are running:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 2000 and XP: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1639">Framework&nbsp;v2.0</a></li>
  <li>Windows Vista and Windows 7: Framework&nbsp;v2.0 is included in Framework&nbsp;v3.x, which is installed by default.</li>
  <li>Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and 11: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=22">Framework&nbsp;v3.5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I am currently only able to perform testing under Windows&nbsp;10. The other Windows versions listed above should work,
   but these are not guaranteed. I mean, they should work without any problems, but well, you know Microsoft.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your system also has the latest security and quality patches for the .Net Framework installed.</p>
<p>For most functions, the hardware requirements (CPU and RAM) are modest by today's standards. <em>Horizon</em> will run in as little as 512 megabytes of RAM, 
   but works best with 1 gigabyte or more. Both 32 and 64-bit processors are supported.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that it is unlikely that there will ever be a Linux version of <em>Horizon</em>. However, the minimal resource requirements mean that it works
   really well in virtualised environments such as <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion">VMware Workstation</a>.
   Although I wouldn't recommend using ancient operating systems such as Windows&nbsp;2000 or Windows&nbsp;XP for general use, <em>Horizon</em> should run 
   just fine and these old operating systems will minimise the resource requirements for the virtual machine.</p>
<p><em>Horizon</em> Version&nbsp;0.13c will be the last release to require .Net&nbsp;2.0 or 3.5.  The next release, due sometime later this century (well,
   probably), will require a minimum of Windows&nbsp;10 with .Net&nbsp;8.0.</p>

<p>This page has been updated (and about bloody time too, I hear you say) and the website has been moved to a new hosting provider.</p>  


<h2>Data</h2>

<p>For various reasons (primarily efficiency), <em>Horizon</em> uses a proprietry file format for DTM data. There are many existing file formats for
   DTM data,  but none of these are directly supported. Data files will need to be converted into a format compatible with <em>Horizon</em>. 
   Currently, the software only provides conversion tools for the 1&nbsp;arcsecond (30m) and 3&nbsp;arcsecond (90 metre)
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission">SRTM</a> datasets. I am able to convert some other formats, 
   but have only completed a user-friendly version of the SRTM conversion tools.</p>

<h3>SRTM</h3>

<p>The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a NASA mission that collected data to create a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth's
   land surfaces. The mission flew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour in February 2000. SRTM used radar interferometry to map approximately 80% of Earth's
   land surface.</p>   
<p>SRTM data should suffice for demonstration and evaluation purposes, but are not recommended if high-accuracy results are required.</p>
<p>The 1 arcsecond SRTM conversion tool has been tested with SRTMHGT files from the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a>. The data are available as
   1&nbsp;by&nbsp;1 degree tiles, so it is usually necessary to download many files. The most user-friendly interface for downloading these files is from
   <a href="http://dwtkns.com/srtm30m/">http://dwtkns.com/srtm30m</a>. You will need to create a login on
   <a href="https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home">NASA Earthdata</a> to download the files.</p>
<p>The 3&nbsp;arcsecond SRTM conversion tool has been tested with the CGIAR-CSI SRTM Version&nbsp;4.1 dataset available from
   <a href="http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org">http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org</a> (both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid">ArcASCII</a> and
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF">GeoTIFF</a> formats, available as 5&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 degree tiles). From here, the files can be
   downloaded by HTTP or FTP using a simple web browser interface.</p>
<p>Further information about obtaining and converting SRTM data is given in Chapter 7 of the documentation (installed along with the executable).</p>

<h3>Ordnance Survey</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a> (OS) is the national mapping agency for Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).
   The OS produces a number of DTM products at varying resolutions, but only the 50m
   <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-terrain-50">Terrain&nbsp;50</a> dataset is free for everyone to download and use.</p> 
<p>A converter for Terrain&nbsp;50 data is not built into <em>Horizon</em>, but you can download the 2023 release of the Terrain&nbsp;50 dataset from
   <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nbiu4uzzzdiyrdlcd9pms/terrain50-2023.zip?rlkey=h90prilo1dbxmwltyqy7qi3mr&st=5q5dtbuv&dl=1">here</a>.
   The ZIP file (103Mb) contains all 2,858 tiles from the dataset converted into the <em>Horizon</em> native format.  To install, simply unzip the file
   into a folder on your local hard drive.</p>
<p>Note that the Terrain&nbsp;50 dataset does not identify internal bodies of water (lakes or rivers). The converted dataset provided has been processed
   with a simple algorithm which attempts to find areas that correspond to internal bodies of water and mark the associated DTM cells accordingly.  
   On the whole it seems to work well, apart from an unexpected expanse of water in East Anglia. This is either a bug or a feature depending upon your
   point of view. Although this body of water does not exist today, it is a low-lying area which would have been shallow wetlands (known as "fens") in 
   prehistory and were drained to create agricultural land in the latter part of the last millenium.</a>
