<p>These old versions are  still available in case you have serious problems getting the latest version to run. However, they are no longer supported.</p>
<p>Please note that installing an earlier version after running a later version can result in unexpected behaviour or crashes due to  incompatibilities in the way program settings are saved in the Windows Registry. If all else fails, delete the saved registry settings from the Tools / Beta / Registry menu.</p>
